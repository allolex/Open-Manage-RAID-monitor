Dell Open Manage Monitor (PERC RAID controller monitoring)

Dell provides tools to access many of the otherwise hidden features in its
hardware. One of the tools, omreport, allows you to pull information out of
open manage. We wanted to check the RAID controller and find out if the RAID
has failed or if a hardware failure has been predicted by the controller.

This script allows you to set up a cron job to query Open Manage on a regular
basis to get the extra information. We use it on a Dell PowerEdge 2950 running
Ubuntu 10.04.
